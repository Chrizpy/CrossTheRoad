# CrossTheRoad

Hi to anyone that found their way to this repo!

This code is from an old project from back when I was still in high school.
I will keep the code as is and just put it up here if anyone wants to either 
take inspiration or have a giggle at old me's C# code.

Now, I will not include all files needed to play the game since it was made using the
framework XNA that microsoft used to deliver, although I think I might have used monogame
which is the open source variant. Nonetheless, I will only upload the code which I wrote and
not the other files that these frameworks generate for you.




If you want to see how the end product looked (I made the graphics myself ;) ) lo and behold!
