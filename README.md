# CrossTheRoad

Hi to anyone that found their way to this repo!

This code is from an old project from back when I was still in high school.
I will keep the code as is and just put it up here if anyone wants to either 
take inspiration or have a giggle at old me's C# code.

Now, I will not include all files needed to play the game since it was made using the
framework XNA that microsoft used to deliver, although I think I might have used monogame
which is the open source variant. Nonetheless, I will only upload the code which I wrote and
not the other files that these frameworks generate for you.




If you want to see how the end product looked (I made the graphics myself ;) ) lo and behold!

Cool thing about this game's graphics is that it's all tile based. All the grass, parts of the roads etc are built with 30x30 tiles.
But yeah, you can see in the level text document how the world is built. Each number will be important as to know which tiles is gonna be printed, some will also serve as a spawn pointer for different cars.
